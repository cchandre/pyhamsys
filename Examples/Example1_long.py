## Parameters
epsilon = 0.027				# parameter of the Hamiltonian system
step = 2 * np.pi / 50		# integration timestep 
N = 50  					# number of trajectories
nf = 1000					# number of points on the Poincaré section per trajectory

## Hamiltonian system and equations of motion

## Initial conditions

## Plot of the Poincaré section
